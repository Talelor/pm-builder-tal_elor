# The Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**   
Write a 2-3 sentence problem statement

**Who experiences this problem?**   
Describe the personas affected by this problem and how frequently they encounter it

**What is the impact of NOT solving this problem?**   
Explain the consequences if this problem remains unaddressed

**What does success look like?**   
Describe how the user's experience will improve once this problem is solved

# User & Stakeholder Discovery

**User & Stakeholder Discovery**

| User Type | Role | Use Frequency | Technical Expertise | Key Needs |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| \[e.g., Developer\] | \[e.g., Software Engineer\] | \[Daily\] | \[High\] | \[Fast, accurate code analysis\] |

**User Journey Mapping:** For each user type, map their journey:

- [ ] **Trigger:** What causes them to need this agent?  
- [ ] **Current Process:** What do they do today (step-by-step)?  
- [ ] **Pain Points:** Where does the current process fail them?  
- [ ] **Desired Experience:** What would be ideal?  
- [ ] **Success Criteria:** How do they know it worked?

# Solution Discovery

**What type of agent is this?**

- [ ] **Analytical Agent** (analyzes data, provides insights)  
- [ ] **Generative Agent** (creates content, code, documents)  
- [ ] **Decision Agent** (makes choices, classifications, routing)  
- [ ] **Orchestration Agent** (coordinates multiple systems/tools)  
- [ ] **Conversational Agent** (interactive, multi-turn dialogue)  
- [ ] **Hybrid** (combination of above)

**High-Level Solution Approach**  
In one sentence, what will this agent do?

**What does the agent need to be good at?**

- [ ] Understanding natural language requirements  
- [ ] Analyzing code structure  
- [ ] Reasoning about technical dependencies  
- [ ] Generating structured output

# 

# Capability

**What specific capabilities will the agent need?**

| Capability | What it does | Why it's needed | Input | Output | Must-have or Nice-to-have: | Complexity |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| e.g., Code Review\] | \[Analyzes code for bugs and best practices\] | \[quick feedback before merging\] | \[Code file or PR\] | \[List of issues and suggestions\] | \[Must-have\] | \[medium\] |

# 

# Success Criteria

**What does "good" look like for this agent?**  
Define what successful agent performance looks like from the user's perspective

**Accuracy/Correctness:**  
Specify the expected quality and reliability standards for agent outputs

**How will we measure success?**  
Outline the evaluation methods and testing approaches

**Metrics:**   
List specific, measurable KPIs to track agent performance
